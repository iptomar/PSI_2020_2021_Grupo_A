    'infHistory' => 'The building where the Luiza Andaluz Foundation now operates has been the scenery for many centuries of immense goodness: initially a hospital for foundling children, later, a convent of Capuchas Sisters, where day and night God was praised.',

    'infHistory2' => 'At the end of the 19th century, the Convent opened a school for poor children. With the Republic and, after many vicissitudes, from January 21, 1925, it became a House with open doors for girls in need of family, shelter and education. A new stage began in its history, now ninety years old.
    These were years of great dedication, of persistent struggle for the good of the girls who were entrusted to the educational community. Years of suffering: those who love, suffer for the sake of the other. Years of joy for the small and great conquests of the daily and of the life of each student.',

    'infHistory3' => 'Over the decades, the Foundation has tried to adjust itself to the social situation of each era in order to provide an adequate response, always keeping Luiza Andaluz`s educational ideal alive: following the Gospel, doing everything in its power to help children and young people to grow for life, at all levels, as she said: "Being good to everyone, especially to the smallest and most despised, is the Gospel lived." (...)
    The girls who passed through the Foundation know that they are heirs of a very rich history of which they are the first protagonists, a history made of small and large victories that only the struggle and persistence of Luiza Andaluz and the educational community over the years made possible, striving for their dignity and for ensuring adequate space and means for their growth.',
